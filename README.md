# README: Linear Regression on Housing Prices

## Project Overview
This project involves using linear regression to predict housing prices based on square footage. The dataset contains housing information such as square footage and price, with 50 rows of data generated programmatically. The goal was to build a regression model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the relationship between actual and predicted housing prices.

## Workflow

### 1. **Dataset Preparation**
- A synthetic dataset was created with two columns:
  - `Square Footage`: Randomly generated values ranging from 500 to 4000.
  - `Price`: Housing prices, calculated using a linear equation with added noise to simulate real-world variability.

- A second dataset with only the `Square Footage` column was also created to test the model's ability to make predictions on new data.

---

### 2. **Model Building**
- **Training and Testing Split**:
  - The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets using `train_test_split`.

- **Feature and Target Separation**:
  - The independent variable (`X`) was set to `Square Footage`.
  - The dependent variable (`y`) was set to `Price`.

- **Linear Regression Model**:
  - Imported from `sklearn.linear_model`.
  - Trained using the training dataset.

---

### 3. **Model Evaluation**
- Performance metrics used:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures average squared differences between actual and predicted prices.
  - **RÂ² Score**: Indicates how well the model explains variance in the target variable.

- Results showed high accuracy, but there was a concern of potential overfitting, as the predicted prices closely mirrored the actual prices in the test set.

---

### 4. **Visualization**
- A scatter plot was created to compare actual vs. predicted prices against square footage:
  - **Blue points**: Actual prices.
  - **Red points**: Predicted prices.

- Adjustments were made to the axes to ensure proper scaling.
- However, the red points for the predicted prices refused to show after initially appearing earlier without the use of plt.xlim(0, 5000) and plt.ylim(0, 700000). that might suggest overfitting?, well if you can help with that let me know.
- Edit: I found the issue, it was the second line of my visualization cell, the first argument was y_test when it should have been X_test

## Key Observations

### Strengths:
- The model accurately predicted housing prices for the test set.
- Visualizations provided clear insights into the model's performance.

### Limitations:
1. **Overfitting**:
   - The model's predicted values were nearly identical to actual values, raising concerns about overfitting. This could indicate that the model may not generalize well to unseen data.

2. **Lack of Feature Diversity**:
   - Only one feature (`Square Footage`) was used for prediction. Real-world housing prices depend on multiple factors such as location, number of bedrooms, and amenities.

## How to Use the Model

### Predict on New Data:
1. Prepare a new dataset with a single column: `Square Footage`.
2. Load the trained model.
3. Use the model's `.predict()` method to generate predictions for housing prices based on the square footage in the new dataset.

---

## Next Steps
1. Add more features to improve the model's predictive power.
2. Use cross-validation to better evaluate the model's generalization ability.
3. Regularization techniques (e.g., Ridge, Lasso) to address overfitting.

## Conclusion
This project provided a foundational understanding of linear regression and its application to a housing price dataset. It highlighted both the strengths and limitations of simple regression models and offered opportunities for further improvement in predictive modeling.
